Use of boost/nondet_random.hpp
------------------------------

The use of this header file is subject to the availability of class
boost::random_device::impl. Boost libraries provide only an example
implementation which the user may use to fit her needs.

Such implementation is distributed by libboost-dev Debian package in
file /usr/share/doc/libboost-dev/examples/random_device.cpp. This file is
generally good enough for most linux users. Please add it to your build
process before filing another bug report agains Boost Debian packages.
