	Building Boost.Python Examples
	------------------------------

1. Ensure package boost-build is installed (for bjam).

2. Copy the contents of examples/libs/python/example elsewhere before
attempting to build, since the build creates files inside the example
directory.

3. Change to the directory created in step 2, then "bjam test".
