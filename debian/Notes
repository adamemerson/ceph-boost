	Thread Support
	--------------

All debian libraries are supposed to be built with _REENTRANT defined
(policy 10.2).  For the jam-built libraries, use "<define>_REENTRANT"
on command line in debian/rules.  For graph library, set in Makefile.


	Documentation
	-------------

Generate the list of documentation files using wget going through
localhost to get the source tree

    path=Packages/boost/alioth/build-area/boost-1.35.0
    wget -r --no-parent --domains=localhost \
	http://localhost/lsrc/$path/index.html
    cd localhost/....
    rm -rf boost
    for f in `find * -type f`; do
        test -f /usr/local/src/$path/$f && echo $f;
    done > df1
    find * -name '*.htm' -or -name '*.html' > df2
    cat df1 df2 | sort | uniq > documentation-files

** On my machine, "http://localhost/lsrc" resolves to "/usr/local/src",
   which is where I unpack and build boost.

* need to symlink .../HTML/boost to /usr/include/boost; when put
  the symlink into the deb, it got converted to a directory during
  installation; use dh_link to do it

* use -Nlibboost-doc with dh_compress to inhibit compressing files in the HTML
  tree


	Examples
	--------

List of example directories obtained using

    find * -name 'example*' -type d > debian/example-files


	Interdependencies
	-----------------

Check using check-interdep.sh

For 1.35.0:

date_time 	depends on serialization
filesystem 	depends on system
graph 		depends on serialization test
iostreams 	depends on regex
regex 		depends on thread
thread 		depends on date_time
wave 		depends on filesystem serialization

Also, bug report #480948 indicates that multi_index, from libboost-dev
itself depends on serialization.
