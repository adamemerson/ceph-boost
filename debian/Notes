	Thread Support
	--------------

All debian libraries are supposed to be built with _REENTRANT defined
(policy 10.2).  For the jam-built libraries, use "<define>_REENTRANT"
on command line in debian/rules.  For graph library, set in Makefile.


	Documentation
	-------------

Generate the list of documentation files using wget going through
localhost to get the source tree

    path=boost_1_37_0
    cd ~/public_html
    ... unpack boost
    cd /tmp
    wget -r --no-parent --domains=localhost \
	http://localhost/~steve/$path/index.html
    cd localhost/....
    rm -rf boost
    for f in `find * -type f`; do \
        test -f ~/public_html/$path/$f && echo $f;
    done > df1
    find * -name '*.htm' -or -name '*.html' > df2
    cat df1 df2 | sort | uniq > documentation-files

* need to symlink .../HTML/boost to /usr/include/boost; when put
  the symlink into the deb, it got converted to a directory during
  installation; use dh_link to do it

* use -Nlibboost-doc with dh_compress to inhibit compressing files in the HTML
  tree


	Examples
	--------

List of example directories obtained using

    find * -name 'example*' -type d > debian/example-files


	Interdependencies
	-----------------

Check using check-interdep.sh
** must do this after installing the -dev packages **

For 1.36.0:

date_time 	depends on serialization
filesystem 	depends on system
graph 		depends on serialization, test
iostreams 	depends on regex
math		depends on test
mpi		depends on graph, python, serialization
regex 		depends on thread
thread 		depends on date_time
wave 		depends on filesystem, serialization

Also, bug report #480948 indicates that multi_index, from libboost-dev
itself depends on serialization.
