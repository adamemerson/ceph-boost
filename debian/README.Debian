Boost for Debian is linked with the STLPort standard C++ libraries.
Your boost-using code must also use STLPort, so do not forget to add
/usr/include/stlport to the compiler's search path, and link against
the stlport library.  You can use commands similar to this one:

  g++ -I/usr/include/stlport foo.cc -lboost_thread -lstlport

There is extensive documentation available in the libboost-doc
package and at www.boost.org.
